# Compute Ledger

> Tracks GPU hours, API/token cost, full-run count, pivot count against Charter §9 caps.
> Manager may NOT authorize L4 full runs, paid/private API, or GPU allocation — human approval required.

- E-0016 D-0095 authorized cap: 3 A800 GPU-hours; consumed upper bound 0.00722222 GPU-h before the valid pre-DEV failure. Retry is authorized under unchanged protocol/run commit `c094f07fa3592c2210f46caba9e69c49a5a92fad` with a remaining hard cap of 2.99277778 A800 GPU-hours; no retry has yet been performed.
