> Human-approval items (AGENTS.md §5) must cite the human decision.

## 2026-07-23 · D-0001 · Session bootstrap & Charter v0.1 drafted
- **Decision (Manager, autonomous):** Established `docs/` ledger structure per AGENTS.md §8; drafted
  Research Charter v0.1 (status: proposed, NOT frozen); registered C1/C2/C3 + H1/H2/H3.
- **Rationale:** Phase-1 deliverable #1. Charter authoring is Manager's own duty (not a research action).
- **Frozen?** No. Charter freeze pending human sign-off + Charter Review (R1/R2/R3) triage.
- **Next:** dispatch (a) novelty-falsification research subagent, (b) 3 independent Charter-Review critics.

## 2026-07-23 · D-0002 · Venue = CHI (primary), UIST excluded
- **Decision (from idea/开题报告, Manager records):** Target venue CHI, not hard-locked; fallbacks IUI/DIS;
  UIST excluded. Any venue change = human-approval item.
- **Frozen?** No.

## 2026-07-23 · D-0003 · Novelty Gate completed (research subagent, commit 2ab33ff)
- **Outcome:** Report `docs/research/2026-07-23-novelty-falsification.md`. 8/8 audited citations VERIFIED,
  0 fabricated. **Mishra non-surjectivity paper (2604.09839) is REAL and accurately quoted — RQ2 basis holds.**
- **Substantive findings (Manager accepts for triage):**
  1. **[MAJOR] C2 over-applies the theory.** Mishra proves non-surjectivity of *internal activations*, NOT
     that any user-relevant *behavioral* threshold is prompt-unreachable. C2 (behavioral) is not entailed.
     → Action: reword C1/C2 to separate internal-state vs behavioral-reachability before Charter Freeze.
  2. **[MAJOR] SemanticLens/Labarta misstated** in 开题报告 — it is a vision/CLIP tool for experts
     (arXiv:2604.11467, CVPR'26 W), and "SemanticLens" (Fraunhofer, Nat.Mach.Intell.'25) is a separate work.
     → Action: correct nearest-neighbor framing.
  3. **[MED] Scoop risk = MEDIUM, not LOW** (charter §3.1 said LOW). Huang&Lim is closest single-channel
     threat (poster, SAE not CAA); Stolfo instruction-steering cuts against C2; name-collision
     "Dual-Channel Steering" already coined. Owed: manual CHI'26/ACM-DL prior-art sweep.
  4. **[MINOR] ActAdd Appendix-B sub-claim UNVERIFIED** → mark [NEEDS EVIDENCE] before it enters the paper.
- **Frozen?** No. These feed the Charter-Review triage; Charter to be revised to v0.2 after critics return.

## Pending human-approval items (NOT yet decided)
- Budget caps (GPU hours, paid-API ceiling, max_full_runs).
- Human-subjects/IRB path for Formative + controlled study.
- Any L4 full run, paid/private API, GPU allocation, external submission.
